# sanic-healthcheck

``sanic-healthcheck`` provides a simple way to add health checks and readiness checks to
your [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic) application. This makes it easier to
monitor your application and ensure it is running in a health state. Monitoring or management
tools can ping these endpoints to determine application uptime and status, as well as perform
application restart to ensure your application isn't running in a degraded state.

``sanic-healthcheck`` was inspired by and borrows from [Runscope/healthcheck](https://github.com/Runscope/healthcheck).
